## About The Project

Skin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer. 
Melanoma, specifically, is responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths, despite being the least common skin cancer. 
The American Cancer Society estimates over 100,000 new melanoma cases will be diagnosed in 2020. 
It's also expected that almost 7,000 people will die from the disease. 
As with other cancers, early and accurate detection—potentially aided by data science—can make treatment more effective.

Through this repo:

* We would like to train CNN to classify if there is a melanoma or a regular mole
* Test the model with actual data
* Submit the model (or retrain in Kaggle competition)
